# calculator

Completed through The Odin Project

https://cedrus32.github.io/Calculator/

This was my third project focusing heavily on JavaScript implementation. Most of the code relies on JavaScript to get, store, and work with user input via click and keydown events.

The biggest challenge I had on this project was finding and correcting bugs in the JS code. Some bug fixes introduced new bugs, and I became very comfortable reading through my code, console logging, identifying inconsistencies in syntax, and ultimately finding the source of the issue at hand.

I'm sure there are bugs I haven't found, and welcome the challenge to fix them if any are identified. ðŸ™‚
